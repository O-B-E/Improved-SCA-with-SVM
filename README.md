# Improved-SCA-with-SVM-CWnano

This repository contains an implementation of a side-channel attack (SCA) targeting **AES-128 encryption**, designed to run on the **ChipWhisperer Nano**. It follows the style and structure of other courses in the ChipWhisperer project.

The attack is based on the method proposed in the paper:  
**_"An Improved Side-Channel Attack Based on Support Vector Machine"_** by Zeng et al.

***Note:*** To use the included traces and models you need to unzip `included.zip` under `SCA_SVM_DATA`.

## Requirements
- **ChipWhisperer Nano** hardware  
- **ChipWhisperer software**, available on the [ChipWhisperer GitHub page](https://github.com/newaetech/ChipWhisperer)
