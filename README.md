# Improved-SCA-with-SVM-CWnano

This repository contains an implementation of a side-channel attack (SCA) targeting **AES-128 encryption**, designed to run on the **ChipWhisperer Nano**.

The attack is based on the method proposed in the paper:  
**_"An Improved Side-Channel Attack Based on Support Vector Machine"_** by Zeng et al.

## Requirements
- **ChipWhisperer Nano** hardware  
- **ChipWhisperer software**, available on the [ChipWhisperer GitHub page](https://github.com/newaetech/ChipWhisperer)  

## References
